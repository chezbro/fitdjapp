# FITDJ iOS App Skeleton

This repository contains the SwiftUI-based FITDJ application scaffold. It targets iOS 15+ and includes placeholder implementations for authentication, workouts, audio, and payments while keeping integration points ready for Spotify, ElevenLabs, Firebase, and StoreKit 2.

Seed JSON, placeholder audio/video folders, and stub services allow the app to boot in a simulator without secrets. Replace stub implementations with production-ready services and add the necessary SDKs (Spotify, Firebase, StoreKit 2) to complete functionality.
